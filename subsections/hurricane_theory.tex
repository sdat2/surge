\label{sec:carnot}

The hurricane can be idealised as a Carnot cycle as in Figure~\ref{fig:hurricane-carnot},
as was originally proposed Kleinschmidt,~1951~\cite{kleinschmidt1951grundlagen},
and reproposed by Emanuel~1986~\cite{lilly1985steady, emanuel1986air,emanuel1987dependence}.

The temperature of the sea surface temperature controls the hurricane.

There was a cold bias in CMIP5 models~\cite{camargo2013global}.

A western boundary current~\cite{hogg1995western} has a thicker

\begin{itemize}
\item thermodynamic disequilibrium
\item cyclogenesis
\item Carnot cycle $\implies$ potential intensity limits.
\item reasons for not reaching potential intensity.
\item super-intensity cyclones.
\item weaknesses.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Potential intensity}
\label{sec:potential_intensity}

\cite{bister2002low}
Therefore given the sea surface temperature, there is some maximum intensity
that a hurricane could reach given the rest of the climate.


\cite{bister1996development,bister1998dissipative, bister2002low}

This makes some simplifying assumptions, the sea is not all at the temperature
of the surface, instead only up to some depth. The depth of warm water
is larger at the western boundary currents, which means that if a hurricane
travels down the axis of the current it can reach a higher intensity than
if it does not.
