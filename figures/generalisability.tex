   \caption{\texttt{eUS-tyr} shows that high $r^2$ values can be obtained using
   either \texttt{lasso} or \texttt{ridge}, but this is unsurprising given $>100$
   features. The regression coefficients learnt are different for the different years
   and algorithms' responsiveness,
   (colored as in Figure~\ref{fig:tau-tau-resp}).}

             as a feature, and the shape of either is quite different.}
