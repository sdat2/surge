\subsection{Fourier Transform}

Initially looking at the statistics of the sea surface height along the
US coast in Figure~\ref{fig:ssh_stats_america}.

The sea surface moves up and down.

The ocean is known to have a red-noise spectrum.

The relationship between the temperature and the sea surface temperature.

The Florida current is a likely source of noise at Miami.

\begin{equation}
F(f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(x) e^{-i 2\pi f x} d x
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_{n} e^{-2 \pi i  k n/ N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N / 2-1} a_{2 n}
e^{-2 \pi i k (2 n)/ N} +\sum_{n=0}^{N / 2-1} a_{2n+1} e^{-2 \pi i k (2 n+1)/ N}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lag Correlation Plot}
\label{sec:lag}

There is a lag, between the two, which becomes anti-phase in the Gulf
of Tonkin (Northern Vietnam).

Some level of lag is understandable, as the mixed layer takes longer
to heat up than the surface itself.
