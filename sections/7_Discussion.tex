\subsection{Future work}
\label{sec:future}
\subsubsection{Model intercomparison}
Different models have different systematic biases (in cyclogenesis etc.)
and also different resolutions. It would be interesting to see how
the responsiveness changes as the resolution decreases, as the difference
between the value at 4km distance (~2m) of the Katrina Hurricane (see Figure~\ref{fig:katrina}),
is quite a lot smaller than the actual value observed at the coast itself (c. 9m according to news reports).
Presumably it must increase with a bound. As model resolution increases the model
timesteps have to increase in frequency so as to avoid numerical blow-up.

\subsubsection{Gauges}
Data is available from tidal gauges along the U.S.~coastline.
Frequencies of data are variable, and the API to extract this data
is difficult to implement. Tidal gauges are also sometimes moved
without note in the dataset.

\subsubsection{Tides}
Models like LLC4320 include tides, and these tides introduce
non-linear tide-surge interaction~\cite{feng2019characteristics} which should be studied.
Famously dangerous storm surges, such as the 1938 New England
Hurricane, coincided with spring high tides.

\subsubsection{Inundation}
Combining the climate models outputs with a SLOSH model could produce
an output which could more directly be compared against the tidal gauges
without the bias created by measuring SSH from the centre of the coastal
cell.


\begin{itemize}
\item Learn the statistical transformation from
      a 4km coast point to real coast.
\item Add in tides using LLC4320, and look at the
      non-linear tide-surge interaction.
\item Higher dimensional machine learning Models
      to capture non-local structural influences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cyclone Problem}
There are insufficient TCs in climate models, because the processes involved
in cyclogenesis are hard to resolve in climate models. This may be
exacerbated by the cold bias (see Seager et~al.~2019~\cite{seager2019strengthening})

\subsection{Model Hysteresis}
The sea surface does not instantly reach its steady state when the sea surface
stress is applied, and it does not recede from its high level, this leads
to the regression being quite distorted, as the assumption would be that data
is iid, when it actually depends significantly on the previous points.
