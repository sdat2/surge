\subsubsection{NEMO models}
\paragraph{Introduction}
\label{sec:nemo}
I was able to use two outputs~ยง~\ref{sec:rean-prod}~\&~ยง~\ref{sec:control-1950-intro}
of use the NEMO ocean engine~\cite{madec2015nemo}, which uses the tripolar ORCA12 grid,
with a  $\frac{1}{12}^{\circ}$
resolution.
ORCA12 is designed so that no coordinate singularities are in the ocean~\cite{madec1996global}.


 The bathymetry is from
 ETOPO2v2~\cite{lecointre2011definition, noaa20062}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo2.html}}
 This is more accurate along the US coastline, using
 direct measurements rather than altimetry data~\cite{noaa20062}.
 Table~\ref{tab:mod-symb} introduces the variables taken from NEMO.

\paragraph{Limitations}

Neither output
include tides, inundation, or wave setup.
The resolution of the models mean that cells are around
8km wide, therefore with sea surface height (SSH) recorded around 4km from the coast.

\subsubsection{2004-5 \texttt{two-year} hourly reanalysis product}
\label{sec:rean-prod}
Dr.~Pierre Mathiot kindly ran a global ocean model with
hourly outputs for the years 2004-5 (see Katrina
in Figure~\ref{fig:katrina}).

\paragraph{EN4 initial conditions}
EN4 is a reanalysis product, starting in 1976,
 that uses all available ocean profiles~\cite{good2013en4, HadObs}
to produce a best guess as to what the properties of the ocean are.


\paragraph{CORE2 forcing}
CORE2 is a set of global air-sea fluxes in 6 hour time steps which are interpolated between~\cite{griffies2012datasets,large2009global,
 hurrell2008new}\footnote{\url{https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/corev2-air-sea-surface-fluxes}}
 (see Figure~\ref{fig:katrina}B-D).
 These been made from the NCEP/NCAR R1 reanalysis product,
 bias corrected with more reliable satellite data data~\cite{core2, core2expert}.
