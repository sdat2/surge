\section{Extreme value theory}
\label{sec:evt}
\subsection{Idealised statistical theory}
By its nature the mean SSH will
not be able to damage the coast
(barring significant sea level rise that is not mitigated),
and life and property will only be put
at risk by the most extreme events~\cite{taleb2019statistical}.

The extreme value theorem is:

Extreme value theory is the provides the extension of this theory
to look at the return period of extreme events of a certain value.

Both require domain of attraction condition~\cite{bucher2018horse}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Either $\forall r \in \mathbb{N} \;\exists \;b_r, \gamma\in \mathbb{R},\; a_r>0: $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \lim _{r \rightarrow \infty} F^{r}\left(a_{r} x+b_{r}\right)=\exp \left\{-(1+\gamma x)^{-1 / \gamma}\right\} \notag \\
     \text { for all } 1+\gamma x>0
    \tag{BM}
    \end{eqnarray}

  \item Or equivalently, there exists a positive function $\psi=\psi (t):$
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \lim _{t \uparrow x^{*}} \frac{1-F(t+\psi(t) x)}{1-F(t)}=(1+\gamma x)^{-1 / \gamma} \notag \\
    \text { for all } 1+\gamma x>0
    \tag{POT}
    \end{eqnarray}
 \end{enumerate}

Normal Choices are POT or Block Maxima, but these strategies require
large amounts of data to converge~\cite{taleb2019much}.

BM leads to Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution,
      whereas POT leads to Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD).

\subsection{Block maxima GEV}
It is trivial to extract the highest SSH value in a given year at a given point
from \texttt{control-1950}.
It was decided not to subtract the low frequency SSH seasonal cycle from the
values first, because it is the absolute height of the sea surface which
creates the hazard rather than the relative height.

\begin{itemize}
\item
\(
\operatorname{GEV}(\mu, \sigma, \xi):
\)
\(
\text{ location, } \mu \in \mathbb{R}
\text{; scale, } \sigma>0
\text{; shape, } \xi \in \mathbb{R}.
\)
\begin{eqnarray}
\operatorname{GEV}(x; \mu, \sigma, \xi)=&
\frac{1}{\sigma} \chi(x)^{\xi+1} e^{-\chi(x)};
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi(x)=&\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\left(1+\xi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\right)^{-1 / \xi} & \text { if } \xi \neq 0 \\
e^{-(x-\mu) / \sigma} & \text { if } \xi=0
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
\item The Gumbel distribution is a special case ($\xi=0$)
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{GUM}(x ; \mu, \sigma)=e^{-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}-e^{-(x-\mu) / \sigma}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

location $\mu$: position of the GEV mean
Return level: value $\eta$ that is expected to
be exceeded on average once every $1/p $periods,
where $1 − p$ is the probability associated with the quantile.
Find zp such that
$G(\eta) = 1 − p$.
Traditionally a GEV where
$\xi<0$ is called a Weibull
distribution, and  $\xi>0$ a Fr\'echet.

Figure~\ref{fig:gev-no} fits the generalised extreme value theorem fitted
on the yearly block maxima for the nearest coastal point to New Orleans.
Figure~\ref{fig:gev_all_points} shows the fit along all points in \texttt{eUS}
for \texttt{c50}.


\subsection{Comparison to POT GPD}
In Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} they use POT methods,
and fit a generalised Pareto distribution.

\subsection{Enforcing an asymptote using potential intensity theory }
As noted in~§~\ref{sec:hurr-theory} there is some maximum size
that a tropical cyclone might be expected to be able to reach given
the climate. This gives us information as to the shape of the probability
distribution beyond what just curve-fitting the tail.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:up-bound-taleb} naively fitting
the GEV to the distribution would be an over-extrapolation of
the relationship if we have a good physical reason for
thinking that there is a maximum
(i.e.~the PI theory §~\ref{sec:hurr-theory}).
