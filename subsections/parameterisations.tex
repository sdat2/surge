\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}


Equation X in Y20 is,

\begin{equation}
 |\tau| = C_d(|U|) \cdot U^2
 \label{eq:tau}
 \end{equation}

 It is unclear whether this increase or decreases at high wind speeds
 \cite{powell2003reduced, donelan2004limiting}. Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} speculates that $C_d$ may naturally continue
to increase with windspeed, making Eq.~\ref{eq:tau} closer to cubic.

We can make sense of Equation~\ref{eq:tau} by analogy to the pressure of an ideal
gas caused by the impact of a molecule of speed $u$, where one factor of
$u$ comes from the probability of collision, and one from the momentum
exchanged during each collision.

\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}
The uncertainty in this parametrization of this may be an explanation as to why there are
not enough Safir-Simpson category 4 and 5 in models~\cite{emanuel2005divine}.

Equation 4 in \cite{zou2017observation},

\begin{equation}
Q_{H}=\rho c_{p} C_{H} U\left(\theta-\theta_{0}\right),
\end{equation}


maintenance of tropical cyclones depend exclusively
 on self-induced heat transfer from the ocean through this route.
