\subsection{Model parameterization}
\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}
Limited observational data.
It is unclear whether this increase or decreases at high wind speeds.

\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}
The misparameterisation of this may be an explanation as to why there are
not enough extremely intense hurricanes in models.
