    Storm surges are hazardous for life and property.
     I propose a new set of methods whereby they can be studied
     within an arbitrary climate model without inundation;
     I introduce simple algorithms for selecting coastlines,
      with two new metrics for the bathymetry and convexity of the coast.
       I define two new metrics for the responsiveness of a coast point to the sea stress state.
        The bathymetry and convexity are not robustly predictive of the responsiveness of coastlines
        in an ORCA12 NEMO hindcast of 2004-5, but show promise.
        Finally I use the potential intensity theory of hurricanes,
         combined with extreme value theory,
        for a 101-year experiment (\texttt{control-1950}, ORCA12, HadGEM3)
        to show that there is a reasonable method for combining physical
        and statistical knowledge to better estimate hazards.
        This should provide
        a strong basis for future work applying these
        methods to the ensemble of global climate models,
        and incorporating observational data.
