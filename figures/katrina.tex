\caption{The representation of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina within the
two year analysis product as seen from three selected points along
the coast around New Orleans (NO). As shown in D, the eye of the TC
crosses passes through this area. The wind stresses experienced at the
the three points are similar (B~\&~C), but the response (A) is much
less significant at the headland than the other two points.
B-D are consistent with CORE2's fields being interpolated from 6~hour
steps as in~\cite{core2expert}.
