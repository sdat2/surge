\subsection{The Theory of Hurricanes}
\label{sec:hurr-theory}

\label{sec:cyclogenesis}
TCs are a finite amplitude instability created by
wind induced sea heat exchange (WISHE);
although there is a thermodynamic disequilibrium between the tropical sea
surface and the atmosphere TCs cannot spontaneously emerge. There is
a clear separation between a tropical storm and a TC
in frequency of occurance against maximum intensity~\cite{emanuel2005divine}.


\label{sec:carnot}

TCs are approximately driven by a Carnot cycle as in Figure~\ref{fig:hurricane-carnot}.
This was initially proposed by Kleinschmidt~1951~\cite{kleinschmidt1951grundlagen},
and then by Emanuel~1986~\cite{emanuel1986air, emanuel1987dependence, lilly1985steady,}.
This converts heat energy of the sea surface
(see Figure~\ref{fig:heat}) into
mechanical energy of the winds, doing the majority of the work against the sea surface,
 where near the coast it can raise a storm surge.
 The minimum central pressure is, (equation 26 in \cite{emanuel1986air}),

\begin{aligned}
&\ln \pi_{c s} \notag \\
&\approx \frac{-\left(\frac{T_{B}-\bar{T}_{\mathrm{out}}}{T_{B}}\right)
\frac{L q_{a}^{*}}{C_{p} T_{s}}\left(\mathrm{RH}_{c}-\mathrm{RH}_{a}\right)_{s}
+\frac{1}{4} \frac{f^{2} r_{0}^{2}}{C_{p} T_{B}}}{1-\left(\frac{T_{B}
-\bar{T}_{\mathrm{out}}}{T_{B}}\right)\left(1+\frac{L q_{a}^{*} \mathrm{RH}_{c s}}{R T_{s}}\right)}
\tag{PI-P}
\end{aligned}

Figure~\ref{fig:emanuel87}\footnote{Automatically Updated Version: \url{http://wxmaps.org/pix/hurpot}.}
 shows that the PI theory fitting the measured
minimum central pressure of the largest storms.
The potential intensity is conventionally viewed through the
maximum windspeed a TC can reach (equation 15-7 in \cite{emanuel2018progress}) is,

\begin{equation}
\left|\mathbf{V}_{s}\right|^{2}=\frac{C_{k}}{C_{D}}
\frac{T_{s}-T_{o}}{T_{o}}\left(k_{0}^{*}-k\right),
\tag{PI}
\label{eq:PI}
\end{equation}

where $C_d$ is the surface drag coefficient $C_k$ is the dimensionless
surface exchange coefficient for enthalpy.
$T_s$ is the sea surface temperature ($K$), $T_o$ is the temperature of the
lower stratosphere at the end of the moist adiabatic rise ($K$).
One can see that the a warmer sea surface, and a cooler lower stratosphere
would both lead to a higher potential intensity in paragraph~\cite{emanuel1991theory, emanuel2018progress}.
Further in \ref{eq:PI} the enthalpy per unit mass (equation 15-8 in \cite{emanuel2018progress}) is


\begin{equation}
k \equiv c_{p} T+L_{v} q,
\label{eq:enthalpy_per_unit_mass}
\end{equation}



where $c_p$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure and $L_{v}$ is the latent heat
of vaporisation. $k_{0}^{*}$ is the saturation enthalpy at the sea
surface~\cite{emanuel2018progress}.\footnote{
There is a positive feedback loop from air cooling adiabatically as it flows down
the pressure gradient, and therefore increasing the enthalpy disequilibrium
$k_{0}^{*}-k$, leading to a root below 700 mbar central pressure called a `hypercane'~\cite{emanuel1987dependence}
where dissipation of energy in areas apart from the sea surface must become important.

Most TCs do not reach their PI.
One reason for this is that
water column is only at the surface temperature
at some depth (the mixed layer), and colder below.
The majority of the cooling of
the sea surface during a TC occurs due to the
upwards mixing of this colder water.
The warm water
is much deeper at the western boundary currents~\cite{hogg1995western},
which means that if a TC
travels down the axis of the current (e.g.~the loop current)
it can reach a higher intensity than
if it travelled 20km to one side~\cite{emanuel2005divine}.


\subsection{Contrast to extratropical cyclones}
In contrast to TCs,  ECs do not need a trigger, forming
spontaneously through the baroclinic instability
in the extratropical atmosphere~\cite{lorenz1960energy}.
ECs seem to come in a continuous spectrum.
Given that they cause
significantly less damage, and no theory has been
 set out for calculating their maximum size,
they will be ignored in the rest of this thesis.
