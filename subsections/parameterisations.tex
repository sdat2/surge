\subsection{Model parameterization}
\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}

Due to limited observational data
it is unclear whether this increase or decreases at high wind speeds
\cite{powell2003reduced, donelan2004limiting}.


\begin{equation}
 |\tau| = C_d(|U|) \cdot U^2
 \label{eq:tau}
 \end{equation}

Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} speculates that $C_d$ may naturally continue
to increase with windspeed up to linearly, making the expression
closer to cubic.s

We can make sense of Equation~\ref{eq:tau} by analogy to the pressure of an ideal
gas caused by the impact of a molecule of speed $u$, where one factor of
$u$ comes from the probability of collision, and one from the momentum
exchanged during each collision.

\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}
The misparameterisation of this may be an explanation as to why there are
not enough Safir-Simpson category 4 and 5 in models~\cite{emanuel2005divine}.
