    \caption{A comparison between the distributions of sea surface height, $\eta$ (SSH/zos).
     above geoid for 2005 (red) and 2004 (blue),
     with the Pearson correlation coefficient, $r_p$, for each moment between the two years in A--D.
     Kurtosis in frame D is the excess above that expected for a normal distribution,
     which shows that areas like NO are highly non-normal (a statistical test
     shows that the probability of it being sampled from a Gaussian is $<10^{-304}$)~\cite{anscombe1983distribution}.
     An artefact in the data is that the mean of all of the points for the coastline
     seems to be uniformly shifted upwards between the two years (A~\&~E),
     where the difference is $0.06\pm0.01$m. }
