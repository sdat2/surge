\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item The picture revealed by our current results broadly agrees well with that
      of~\cite{ZannaPreprint}, despite the current model being twenty four times
      the temporal resolution, and three times the lateral resolution.
%\item However each year of data does not fully sample the distribution
       (I mean that there can't be the expected fractional number of storms
        in a location in a year), but there may be ways around this.
\item As the coast is a self-similar fractal~\cite{mandelbrot1967long, richardson1961problem},
      it is unclear which length scale to average over to find summary statistics
      for a point on the coast. A reasonable solution would be to give the
      regression algorithm a number of these, and make it decide what is relevant.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Current Priorities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Refine measure of the responsiveness  (storm efficiency in~\cite{ZannaPreprint})
      of a coastline unit to a wind stress event.
\item Try to untangle the contribution of
	    convexity, and bathymetry to the responsiveness.
\end{itemize}
