    \caption{A comparison between the distributions of SSH, ($\eta$)
     for 2005 (red) and 2004 (blue).
     Kurtosis in frame D, shows that areas like NO are highly non-Gaussian ($\mathbb{P}$ of it being sampled from a Gaussian is $<10^{-304}$~\cite{anscombe1983distribution}).
     The means of  \texttt{eUS}
     are shifted upwards between the years (A~\&~E) by $0.06\pm0.01$. }
