\subsubsection{\texttt{control-1950} daily means}

\label{sec:control-1950-intro}

The second source of data was the \texttt{control-1950} HadGEM3 experiment (\texttt{c50}),
made available via the PRIMAVERA project.
The HadGEM3 coupled climate model~\cite{williams2018met, FurtherInfo},
 was the Met Office's submission to CMIP6,
although \texttt{control-1950} is not a standard CMIP6 experiment~\cite{eyring2016overview}
.\footnote{CMIP is the coupled model intercomparison program,
whose models form part of the scientific basis for the IPCC
reports (e.g.~\cite{SROCC}).}

\texttt{control-1950} has its forcing kept at
1950s levels for 101 360-day years. Outputs are recorded as daily
means~\cite{williams2018met, FurtherInfo}.\footnote{\url{https://view.es-doc.org/

Due to time constraints, and varied model grids, only the SSH outputs were used in this report.
