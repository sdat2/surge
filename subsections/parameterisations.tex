\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}


Equation 9 in Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} is,

\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol{\tau} = C_d(|U_{10}|)\cdot \rho_{\mathrm{air}} \cdot U_{10}{}^2  \;{}\mathbf{\hat{U}_{10}}
 \label{eq:tau}
 \end{equation}

where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho_{\mathrm{air}}$ is the density of the air,
$U_{10}$ is the wind speed 10m above the surface, and $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the sea surface stress.
 It is unclear how $C_d$ changes at high wind speeds
 \cite{powell2003reduced}, as initially roughness increases
 due to the waves, but this could decrease~\cite{powell2003reduced}
 or reach a limit~\cite{donelan2004limiting}.


\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}

% \input{figures/param_figs}

Equation 4 in \cite{zou2017observation},

\begin{equation}
Q_{H}=
\rho_{\mathrm{air}} \cdot c_{p} \cdot C_{H}(|U_{10}|) \cdot
U_{10} \cdot \left(T_{\mathrm{air}}
-T_{\mathrm{ocean}}\right),
\end{equation}

where $Q_{H}$ is the heat transferred downwards, $c_p$ is the heat capacity of the air,
$C_{H}$ is the heat transfer coefficient,
$T_{\mathrm{air}}$ is the temperature of the atmosphere, and
$T_{\mathrm{ocean}}$ is the temperature of the ocean.
