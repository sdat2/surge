Machine Learning\footnote{The use of the term Machine Learning (ML) is unfortunate,
I would prefer it if ``Learning Algorithms'' or ``Advanced Statistical Modelling''
 were used by the field as I find these more descriptive.
  Perhaps due to the pressures research grant proposals and IPOs,
   the field tends to use the quite cryptic labels `AI' and `ML',
   and I will do likewise for consistency.
   I here define define Machine Learning as any algorithm applied to data
    to extract information which is more advanced than classical statistics.
    This may seem hopelessly broad, but I have not heard of one better. }
algorithms are often directly inspired by physical processes (e.g.\
stochastic differential equations (SDEs)) and concepts (e.g.\ transfer entropy).


This work follows in the footsteps of the late Professor Sir David MacKay
in two respects: in its focus on the using a Bayesian framework for inference~\cite{ITILA, MacKay91},
and in its ultimate goal to provide clear information about climate~\cite{mackay2008sustainable}.

I note that because of the rotation-induced explicit-symmetry breaking, for western ocean boundaries~\cite{hogg1995western},
 any model that works here should generalise better to East Asia (Vietnam, Philippines,
  and China) than it would to the United Kingdom.
