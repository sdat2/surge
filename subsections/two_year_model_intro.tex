\subsubsection{NEMO models}
\paragraph{Introduction}
\label{sec:nemo}
I was able to use two outputs~ยง~\ref{sec:rean-prod}~\&~ยง~\ref{sec:control-1950-intro}
of use the European NEMO ocean engine~\cite{madec2015nemo}, which uses the ORCA12 grid, with a  $\frac{1}{12}^{\circ}$
resolution.
This is a tripolar ocean grid,
designed so that no coordinate singularities are in the ocean~\cite{madec1996global}.


 The bathymetry used is based on
 ETOPO2v2~\cite{lecointre2011definition, noaa20062}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo2.html}}
 This is more accurate along the US coastline, using
 direct measurements rather than altimetry data~\cite{noaa20062}.
 Table~\ref{tab:mod-symb} introduces the variables taken from NEMO.

\paragraph{Limitations}

Neither of the outputs
include tides, inundation (the flooding of land), or wave setup.
The resolution of the models mean that in the region of interest cells are around
8km wide. Therefore the centre at which the sea surface height (SSH) is recorded,
is around 4km from the coast.

\subsubsection{2004-5 \texttt{two-year} hourly reanalysis product}
\label{sec:rean-prod}
Dr.~Pierre Mathiot kindly ran a global two-year ocean model with
hourly outputs for the years 2004-5 (see Katrina
in Figure~\ref{fig:katrina}).

\paragraph{EN4 initial conditions}
EN4 is a reanalysis product, starting in 1976, that uses all available ocean profiles
(through the ARGO program etc.)~\cite{good2013en4, HadObs}
to produce a best guess as to what the salinity, temperature,
and dynamic heigh of the ocean is.


\paragraph{CORE2 forcing}
CORE2 is a set of global air-sea fluxes~\cite{griffies2012datasets,large2009global,
 hurrell2008new}\footnote{\url{https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/corev2-air-sea-surface-fluxes}}
 that have been made from the NCEP/NCAR R1 reanalysis product,
 bias corrected with more reliable sattelite data data~\cite{core2, core2expert}.
 CORE2 fluxes  are produced in 6 hour time steps which are interpolated
 (see Figure~\ref{fig:katrina}B-D).
