\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:8_Conclusion}

Storm surges rise out of the sea due to the stress applied to the surface,
with their size dependent to the size of the stress above and
the slope of the bathymetry beneath.
This thesis should provide a basis for
future studies, as it radically reduces the computational cost
of training algorithms, choosing only the
land adjacent cells.

As set out, we could be able to combine the insights of
extreme value and TC potential intensity theories to allow
us to more accurately estimate the hazards posed to coastal communities
in the future.
