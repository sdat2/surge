Let $X_{1}, X_{2} \ldots, X_{n} \ldots$ be a sequence of independent and
identically-distributed random variables, and $M_n = \max\{X_1, \ldots X_n\}$.
For a sequence of real numbers $(a_n, b_n) \exists: a_n>0$, and
$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} P\left(\frac{M_{n}-b_{n}}{a_{n}} \leq x\right)=F(x)$
where $F$ is a non-degenerate distribution function, then the limit distribution
$F$ belongs to either the Gumbel, the Frechet, or the Weibull family.
However as T19~\cite{taleb2019statistical} states, `life is lived in the pre-asymptotics',
and it is not clear how long it would take to converge.
