\caption{Distance to isobaths from points on East US~coast. MM is close to 500m
contour, as the bathymetry rapidly drops off, whereas at NO the drop off is more
gradual.}

\caption{The correlation matrix between the different isobath's distance's to
the East~US coast. High correlation between adjacent isobaths
suggests that multicolinearity will a problem for this metric~\cite{faul2019concise}.}
