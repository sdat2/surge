    Storm surges are very damaging events, both in terms of lives and
    property. I propose a new suite of methods whereby they can be
    systematically studied within a climate model.
    I introduce simple algorithms for selecting coastlines,
    with two new metrics for the bathymetry and convexity of the coast
    within an arbitrary climate model.
    These are tied to two new metrics for the responsiveness of a
    coastline point to the sea stress state, where the relationship
    is static between coastlines in an ORCA12 nemo hindcast of 2004-5.
    Finally I use the potential intensity theory of hurricanes, combined with
    a 101 year experiment and extreme value theory, to show that the
    there is a reasonable method for combining physical and Statistical
    knowledge to better estimate hazards.
