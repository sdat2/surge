\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:8_Conclusion}


Further work must deal effectively with all of the systematic errors
highlighted in Table~\ref{tab:syst_error} so that we can produce
an unbiased estimate of hazard from available data.
There is a consistent `responsiveness' throughout

thesis, but further work is needed to illuminate its cause.
The methods introduced here reduce the computational cost
of training algorithms, through choosing only the
land-adjacent cells.
As set out, combining the insights of
extreme value and TC potential intensity theories should allow
us to more accurately estimate the hazards posed to coastal communities.
