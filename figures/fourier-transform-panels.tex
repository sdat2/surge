\caption{Fourier Transform~\cite{cooley1965algorithm} of SSH demeaned by
         coastal point, and low (left) and high (right) pass filtered respectively,
         with a threshold of 2 yr$^{-1}$ (justified by
         Figure~\ref{fig:lpredthresh}). Although not noticeably different in
         the low pass filter (left), Miami and other headlands
         are noticeably less variable in the high pass filter. }

\caption{Miami (MM) has more low frequency noise.
         Both this and Figure~\ref{fig:no-hp-lp} above
         show an increase in the low amplitude signal with time,
         which could be explained by the spin
         up of \texttt{tyr} from EN4.}
