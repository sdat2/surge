\subsubsection{\texttt{control-1950}}
\label{sec:control-1950-intro}

The second source of data was made available via the PRIMAVERA consortium.
HADGEM3 coupled climate model~\cite{williams2018met, FurtherInfo},
which was the Met Office's submission to CMIP6,
although this particular experiment is not standard to CMIP6~\cite{eyring2016overview}.

The experiment made available was \texttt{control-1950}, where the forcing is kept at
1950s levels for 101 360-day years. Outputs are recorded as daily means~\cite{williams2018met, FurtherInfo}.\footnote{\url{https://view.es-doc.org/

As is shown in Figure 19 of~\cite{williams2018met},
HADGEM3 seems to systematically underrepresent the number of TCs compared to observations,
 particularly in the North Atlantic.
 This is probably caused by poor resolution of cyclogenesis~\cite{tomassini2017interaction}.
