            The deviation from the fitted distribution
            is shown in A~\&~C
            - does this represent TCs? (see Figure~\ref{fig:return_hyp_new}). The parameters above are quoted with 1$\sigma$ error bars.
            C's error bars are 2$\sigma$.}

   The confidence intervals, particularly in $\xi$, show that the GEV MLE fit of the
   is relatively poor. $\xi$ is more likely to be negative
   in the Gulf of Mexico, which could because of higher
   TC activity along this coastline (Figure~\ref{fig:top-100}). The $r_p$ above
   show that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are highly correlated (all $r_p$ have 1\%$\gg$p)
   $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are also correlated with the responsiveness in ยง~\ref{sec:responsiveness}
   (for $\mu$: $r_p=0.44\pm0.02$, p$<10^{-10}$).}
