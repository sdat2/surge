\subsection{Model parameterization}
\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}
Limited observational data.
It is unclear whether this increase or decreases at high wind speeds.
\cite{powell2003reduced, donelan2004limiting}

Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} speculates that $c_d$ may naturally continue
to increase with windspeed up to linearly, making the expression
closer to cubic.


\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}
The misparameterisation of this may be an explanation as to why there are
not enough extremely intense hurricanes in models.
