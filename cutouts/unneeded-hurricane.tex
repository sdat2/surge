``Cyclogenesis is one of the great
 mysteries of the tropical atmosphere''~\cite{emanuel2018progress};
although there is thermodynamic disequilibrium between the tropical sea
surface and the atmosphere TCs cannot spontaneously emerge. As first shown by
Gray 1975~\cite{gray1975tropical} there are
 diverse phenomena that triggered the growth of TC:

 In the North Atlantic, the primary triggers are African easterly waves (AEWs),
 that sometimes deepen into tropical depressions and then hurricanes,
 although AEWs can be poorly resolved in models~\cite{tomassini2017interaction}.
 Cyclogenesis can also be caused by a cold front that penetrates the tropics.


Bister~\&~Emanuel~2002~\cite{bister2002low} provides an algorithm whereby given the rest of the climate
there is some maximum intensity that a hurricane could reach~\cite{bister2002low}
as a product of a development of Emanuel's work~\cite{bister1996development,
bister1998dissipative, bister2002low}
