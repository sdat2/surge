\subsection{\texttt{surge} repository}

My primary code git repository is called `\texttt{surge}'.
It is quite large, and very little of the code is worth reproducing here,
as the logical structure of any interesting code is represented by the
algorithms included in the report.

\verbatiminput{../surge/environment/cloc.txt}

Below is the README of the main repository:

\verbatiminput{../surge/README.md}

\subsection{\texttt{scikit-extremes} repository}

To implement models from univariate extreme value theory, I built
on an unfinished repository that I locally installed from github,
called \texttt{scikit-extremes}.

\verbatiminput{../scikit-extremes/cloc.txt}

\subsection{\texttt{report} repository}

I wrote the report and presentations in \LaTeX.
