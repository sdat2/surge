\caption{Convexity metric along the east U.S.~coast.
         The three panels above show bay like concavity in blue, and convexity
         in red. At the largest $\sigma$ only the largest headlands such as
         Florida are visible (C), whereas the smallest bays are visible at a lower
        $\sigma$ (A).
