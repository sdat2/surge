\subsubsection{Sea surface wind stress}


Equation 9 in Y20~\cite{ZannaPreprint} is,

\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol{\tau} = C_d(|U_{10}|)\cdot \rho_{\mathrm{air}} \cdot U_{10}{}^2  \;{}\mathbf{\hat{U}_{10}}
 \label{eq:tau}
 \end{equation}

 It is unclear whether how $C_d$ changes at high wind speeds
 \cite{powell2003reduced}, as initially roughness increases
 due to the waves, but this could decrease~\cite{powell2003reduced}
 or reach a limit~\cite{donelan2004limiting}.


\subsubsection{Sea surface wind induced heat transfer}

% \input{figures/param_figs}

Equation 4 in \cite{zou2017observation},

\begin{equation}
Q_{H}=\rho c_{p} C_{H} U\left(\theta-\theta_{0}\right),
\end{equation}


TCs depend
on self-induced heat transfer from the ocean through this route,
and so this is a source of systematic error, to explain why there are
not enough Saffir-Simpson category
4 and 5 in CMIP models~\cite{emanuel2005divine}.
