\section{Preprocessing coastal data}
\subsection{Coastal point statistics}
The sea surface height in the model is measured relative to
a reference Geoid, which is the surface that a fluid would occupy
in the absence of density contrasts and ocean currents around an
azimuthally symmetric Earth of the same size and rotation frequency.
Some dynamic topography emerges because of the
currents and density contrasts (Figures~\ref{fig:zos}).
\input{figures/2d_fields/zos.tex}



While the first moment around the mean is trivial, we also define the third,

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Skew}[X]\equiv \mathrm{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{3}\right]
=\frac{\mathrm{E}\left[(X-\mu)^{3}\right]}{\left(\mathrm{E}\left[(X-\mu)^{2}\right]\right)^{3 / 2}},
\end{equation}

and fourth as the excess above the Gaussian~\cite{taleb2019statistical},

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Kurt}[X]=
\mathrm{E}\left[\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{4}\right]-3
\equiv \frac{\mathrm{E}\left[(X-\mu)^{4}\right]}{\left(\mathrm{E}\left[(X-\mu)^{2}\right]\right)^{2}}-3.
\end{equation}


Initially looking at the statistics of the sea surface height along the
US coast in Figure~\ref{fig:ssh_stats_america}.

Looking at the individual points' SSH (Figure~\ref{fig:individual_zos} in ยง~\ref{sec:sum-var-stat}),
does not reveal any discontinuity in the data in the two year period,
 but Figures~\ref{fig:four-trans-panels}-\ref{fig:mm-hp-lp}
suggest that this might be caused by model spin up from the
EN4 initial conditions using the CORE2 forcing.
On the right of the plots (\ref{fig:ssh_stats_america}A--D)
is the Pearson regression coefficient $r_p$,
between the two years for that moment, which shows that the mean and
standard deviation of a point are relatively static between the years, but the
higher order moments of skew and kurtosis
(\ref{fig:ssh_stats_america}C~\&~D) are more sensitive to the
random incidence of storms along different areas of the coast.




\subsection{Fourier Transform}
\label{sec:fourier}

The fourier transform is defined as,

\begin{equation}
F(f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(x) e^{-i 2\pi f x} d x,
\end{equation}

which in discrete form is,


\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_{n} e^{-2 \pi i  k n/ N}=&\sum_{n=0}^{N / 2-1} a_{2 n}
e^{-2 \pi i k (2 n)/ N}  \\ &+\sum_{n=0}^{N / 2-1} a_{2n+1} e^{-2 \pi i k (2 n+1)/ N}/ \notag
\end{eqnarray}

Fourier transforms of real signals have Hermitian symmetry,

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}{(-g(x))}=\mathcal{F}(g(x))^{*},
\end{equation}

$\implies$ negative frequencies have no information not in the positive.


The ocean is known to have a red-noise spectrum.
The relationship between the temperature and the sea surface temperature.
The Florida current is a likely source of particularly red noise at Miami
(Figures~\ref{fig:vos}~\&~\ref{fig:uos}).
The general eddy activity is visible in Figures~\ref{fig:vos}~\&~\ref{fig:uos}
as the loop current has formed a secondary vortex ring moving northwards
in Figures~\ref{fig:uos}~to~\ref{fig:vos}.

\subsection{Lag Correlation Plot}
\label{sec:lag}

\input{figures/lag-panels.tex}

Lag correlation is defined as,

\begin{equation}
r_{k}=
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\left(X_{i}
-\bar{Y}\right)\left(X_{i+k}-\bar{Y}\right)}
{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(X_{i}
-\bar{Y}\right)^{2}}.
\end{equation}

There is a lag, between the two,
which becomes anti-phase in
Northern Vietnam.
Some level of lag is understandable,
as the mixed layer takes longer
to heat up than the surface itself.
