\section{Acknowledgements}
\subsection{Personal Thanks}
Dr.\ Dan Jones (British Antarctic Survey) has been an invaluable help throughout this project.
Dr.\ Laure Zanna (New York University) was a useful counsel as to what is feasible,
 and what the common views in the literature were.
Dr.\ Pierre Mathiot (Met Office) also deserves my thanks for
producing the high-resolution ORCA12 data that I used, and
for answering my queries.
I also received advice from Dr.\ Rory Bingham (Bristol).
I hope that in the fullness of time these collaborators will be rewarded
as co-authors, as we expand and publish the
work begun here.

PRIMAVERA received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020
Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no.~641727.


\subsection{Resources Used}

This report was typeset in \LaTeX\
with \texttt{python3.matplotlib}~\cite{Hunter:2007} and \texttt{draw.io}~\cite{DrawIO}
for original figures, WebPlotDigitiser for data extraction~\cite{WebPlotDigitiser},
and Mathpix for maths extraction~\cite{mathpix}.
It makes extensive uses of the \texttt{sklearn} library~\cite{scikit-learn} as highlighted in the report.
The \texttt{cmocean} package~\cite{thyng2016true}\footnote{\url{https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/}}
provided oceanography standard colour maps.
I used Panolpy and \texttt{ncview}\footnote{\url{http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html}}
for inspecting NetCDF files.

I made use of these textbooks:~\cite{roisin2010GFD,williams2011ocean,ITILA,
sivia2006data,williams2006gaussian,
}.\footnote{\url{http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf
}}
I found Stephen Pinker's book~\cite{pinker2015sense} especially useful and entertaining.

The code listing for this report is available as a \texttt{python3} repository on Gitlab~\cite{gitlab, skextremes}.
 I have tried to write using PEP8 style\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}}
 and have been helped by \texttt{pylint} and Pycharm.\footnote{\url{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/}}
 Errors are dealt with as per the Physics formula booklet~\cite{MathsFormulaBooklet}
 by the \texttt{python3.uncertainties}
 package~\cite{lebigot2010uncertainties}.\footnote{\url{https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/}}

 To move and process the large quantity of climate data on the HPCs I used \texttt{tmux}
 to run \texttt{bash}, \texttt{python3}, and \texttt{fortran} scripts.
