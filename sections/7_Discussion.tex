\subsection{Future work}
\subsubsection{Model intercomparison}
Different models have different systematic biases (in cyclogenesis etc.)
and also different resolutions. It would be interesting to see how
the responsiveness changes as the resolution decreases.
Presumably it must increase with a bound.

\subsubsection{Gauges}
Data is available from tidal gauges along the U.S.~coastline.
Frequencies of data are variable, and the API to extract this data
is difficult to implement. Tidal gauges are also sometimes moved
without note in the dataset.

\subsubsection{Tides}
Models like LLC4320 include tides, and these tides introduce
non-linear tide-surge interaction which should be studied.
Famously dangerous storm surges, such as the 1938 New England
Hurricane, coincided with spring high tides.

\subsubsection{Inundation}
Combining the climate models outputs with a SLOSH model could produce
an output which could more directly be compared against the tidal gauges
without the bias created by measuring SSH from the centre of the coastal
cell.


\begin{itemize}
\item Learn the statistical transformation from
      a 4km coast point to real coast.
\item Add in tides using LLC4320, and look at the
      non-linear tide-surge interaction.
\item Higher dimensional machine learning Models
      to capture non-local structural influences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cyclone Problem}
There are insufficient TCs in climate models, because the processes involved
in cyclogenesis are hard to resolve in climate models.

\subsection{Model Hysteresis}
The sea surface does not instantly reach its steady state when the sea surface
stress is applied, and it does not recede from its high level.


\subsection{Summary of Systematic Errors}
Table~\ref{tab:syst_error} shows the list of systematic errors that effect the
answer.

\begin{tabular}{l L{8.5cm}}
%\hline \hline
\textbf{Effect} & \textbf{Source}\\
\hline
($-$) & Coarsening of time to daily outputs.\\
($-$) & Lack of cyclogenesis  $\implies$ not enough
        TCs~\cite{tomassini2017interaction, williams2018met, FurtherInfo}.\\
($\pm$) & Parameterisation of heat transfer $\implies$ wrong TC strength.\\
($\pm$) & Parameterisation of wind stress $\implies$ wrong TC surge.\\
($-$) & SSH 4km out from the coast (centre of cell).\\
($\pm$) & No non-linear surge-tide interaction.\\
($-$) & Limited wave build up.\\
($-$) & Long TC return periods $> 100$~yrs (e.g.~New England).\\
