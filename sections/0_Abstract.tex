    ORCA12 model. Tropical cyclones (TCs). Extratropical cyclones (ECs).
    I introduce simple algorithms for selecting coastlines,
    with two new metrics for the bathymetry and convexity of the coast
    within an arbitrary climate model.
    These are tied to two new metrics for the responsiveness of a
    coastline point to the sea stress state, where the relationship
    is static between coastlines in an ORCA12 nemo hindcast of 2004-5.
