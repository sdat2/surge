    \caption{An idealised Carnot cycle where air parcels travel clockwise:
            travelling isothermally inwards into the eye-wall extracting enthalpy
            from the sea, and gaining entropy through kinetic energy dissipation;
            moist adiabatically thrust up into the stratosphere
            at the eye-wall and out to some some subsidence point;
            initial isothermal descent, albeit with some loss through radiation;
            final moist adiabatic descent~\cite{emanuel2018progress}. }
