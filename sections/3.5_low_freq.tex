\section{Preprocessing coastal data}
\subsection{Fourier Transform}
\label{sec:fourier}

The sea surface moves up and down.

The ocean is known to have a red-noise spectrum.

The relationship between the temperature and the sea surface temperature.

The Florida current is a likely source of noise at Miami.

\subsection{Lag Correlation Plot}
\label{sec:lag}

There is a lag, between the two, which becomes anti-phase in the Gulf
of Tonkin (Northern Vietnam).

Some level of lag is understandable, as the mixed layer takes longer
to heat up than the surface itself.
