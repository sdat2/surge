    \caption{An attempt to check whether there are discontinuities
     over the special points, to explain the offsets of the means.
     The points are ordered from Eastport (EP) (furthest north east),
     to Rockport (RP) (furthest south west). From the plot it is visible
     that there is a low frequency annual component to each signal, and that
     the excursions are more common during autumn and winter, with
     relative calm in spring.}
