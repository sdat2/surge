   \caption{As shown if you only
   observe a distribution up to some value M,
    you may be tempted to fit a line through the
   data (dotted blue line).
   But if there were in fact a limit to the distribution at H,
   you would be overestimating
   the true number of very extreme events (red curve)
   and also predict events that were larger than were possible.}
